== Bitcoin Overview

Bitcoin, unlike traditional banking and payment systems, does not require trust in third parties. Instead of relying on a central trusted authority, Bitcoin allows each user to verify every aspect of the system using software running on their own computer. In this chapter, we will examine Bitcoin from a high-level perspective, following a transaction through the system and observing how it is recorded on the blockchain, the distributed ledger of all transactions. Subsequent chapters will explore the technology behind transactions, the network, and mining.

=== Bitcoin Structure

The Bitcoin system is composed of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which represents the official record of all transactions.

Each example in this chapter is based on a real transaction on the Bitcoin network, simulating interactions between different users sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction in the Bitcoin network on the blockchain, we will use a blockchain explorer to visualize each phase. A blockchain explorer is a web application that functions like a search engine for Bitcoin, allowing users to search addresses, transactions, and blocks, and observe the relationships and flows between them.

Popular blockchain explorers include:

* [Blockstream Explorer](https://blockstream.info)
* [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space)
* [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com)

Each of these tools has a search feature allowing users to input a Bitcoin address, transaction hash, block number, or block hash to retrieve corresponding information from the Bitcoin network.
